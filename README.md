# Code for SGD on singular 1D and 2D models

Run SGD on 1D and 2D models that are linear in the data and polynomial in their parameters. 

Main classes and functions are in the library (lib) especially see onedmodel.py for the model, SGD runner and utility functions.

Experiments are ran in the notebooks especially see sgd1d.ipynb and sgd_slt_2d.ipynb. For Fokker plank see FK_finite_volume
