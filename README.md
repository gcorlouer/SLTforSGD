# SGD on degenerate 1D and 2D loss-landscape

This project contains python code to to study the influence of degenerate directions in the loss landscape on SGD dynamics.
SGD is run on 1D and 2D models that are linear in their inputs and polynomial in their parameters. 

See blog post: [Degeneracies are sticky for SGD](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JDrxA3vwZAKZfmShz/degeneracies-are-sticky-for-sgd)
## Codebase structure
The main classes are in the in the lib/ directory.
* `lib/config/`: Contains model, training and trajectory generation config parameters
* `lib/models/`: Contains 1D and 2D polynomial models
* `lib/training/`: Contain training module, SGD trajectory generation and sweep across hyperparameters
* `Fokker_Planck` and `integrator` are for studying trajectories generated by solving the Fokker-Planck equation on the 1D models.
* `lib/utils`: Utils for plotting
The file `SGD_utils` contains code from a previous, much less modular, version.


## Usage

Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirement.txt` and run experiments in notebooks.

Install package with `pip -install e.`

To see examples of SGD escaping in 1D and comparison with the Bayes posterior running the codebase, see `notebooks/sgd1d.py` and other notebooks.
